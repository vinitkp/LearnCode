A learning platform for an introduction to programming


Idea
====

A platform-agnostic automated judge, but with a goal to support learning. The initial idea is of developing an Eclipse-plugin, so we can leverage a client-side debugging support and avoid artificial constraints put up competitive environments.


Implications
============

This can be used in the official course for "Introduction to Programming".
