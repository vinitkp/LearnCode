#LEARNCODE#

###finally### is an assembly output generated by *finally.cpp*, which could be used to test whether the output generated by the program is 
same as the *output file* where inputs are provided by *input file*

The program which has to be tested should be provided as an argument to *finally*
##Eg#
if my program is test.c then I should write
>	./finally test.c

*input.txt* and *output.txt* should be present in the same folder as *finally*

Currently, it supports only C.

Feel free to add issues
